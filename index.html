    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>As a Security Researcher Intern at Webel, my role encompasses conducting meticulous cybersecurity analysis and digital forensics. At Anachroni, as a Junior Developer, I leverage my specialization in AI and Machine Learning from Techno India University to engineer innovative solutions. We're dedicated to staying ahead of security threats, strengthening incident response capabilities, and harnessing AI to drive technological advancements.

      My journey began with a commendable 17th rank at the Kolkata Police Hackathon, which led to an internship with the Special Task Forceâ€”where we enhance cybersecurity measures. This recognition, combined with my educational pursuit in Computer Science Engineering, solidifies my core competencies in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, preparing me to contribute meaningfully to the tech industry's evolving landscape.</p>
